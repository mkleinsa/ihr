\title{Calculate the standard deviation of the rate of change}
\usage{
sd_roc(data, timelag = 1, inter_gap = 15, tz = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{DataFrame object with column names "id", "time", "hr"}

\item{timelag}{Integer indicating the time period (# minutes) over which rate
of change is calculated. Default is 1, e.g. rate of change is the change in
heart rate over the past 1 minute divided by 1}

\item{inter_gap}{\strong{Default: 15.} The maximum allowable gap (in minutes) for interpolation. The values will not be interpolated between the glucose measurements that are more than inter_gap minutes apart.}

\item{tz}{A character string specifying the time zone to be used. System-specific (see \code{\link{as.POSIXct}}), but " " is the current time zone, and "GMT" is UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated). Invalid values are most commonly treated as UTC, on some platforms with a warning}
}
\value{
A tibble object with two columns: subject id and standard deviation
of the rate of change values for each subject.
}
\description{
The function \code{sd_roc} produces the standard deviation of the rate of change
values in a tibble object.
}
\details{
A tibble object with one row for each subject, a column for subject id
and a column for the standard deviation of the rate of change.

When calculating rate of change, missing values will be linearly interpolated
when close enough to non-missing values.

Calculated by taking the standard deviation of all the ROC values for each
individual subject. NA rate of change values are omitted from the
standard deviation calculation.
